## Statistical Inference for Everyone (sie)

<img src="figs/Saturn_with_Dice.png" alt="SIE" style="width: 250px;"/>

This is a new approach to an introductory statistical inference textbook, motivated by probability theory as logic.  It is targeted to the typical *Statistics 101* college student, and covers the topics typically covered in the first semester of such a course.  It is freely available under the Creative Commons License, and includes a software library in Python for making some of the calculations and visualizations easier.  

* Download the [latest version of the book]
* Download the [latest version of the software].  It requires the installation of a scientific distribution of Python, such as the [Anaconda distribution].
* Watch the [seminar I give outlining the motivation and philosophy of the book].


The book is [now available on Amazon], or directly [on Createspace]!

For instructors who want to see a more technical justification for this approach, you can see a [technical supplement] that I am putting together.
