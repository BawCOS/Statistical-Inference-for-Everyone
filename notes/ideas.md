    Dice

    Imagine rolling two ordinary dice. Write down a complete set of possible outcomes for the two dice. How many different outcomes are there? Assign each outcome a probability, assuming that the dice are fair. To answer the following questions, count the cases for the desired outcome and divide by the total number of cases.

    What is the probability that you will roll "8" (total of both dice)?"

    What is the probability that you will roll "8", given that one of the dice is a "5"?

    What is the probability that one of the dice is a "5", given that you have rolled "8"?

    Funny dice

    You have two dice, A and B. Die A has four sides with two spots and two sides with six spots. Die B has six sides with three spots. If you toss the two dice together, what is the probability that Die B will beat Die A? Justify your answer.

    Funny Dice 2

    In your collection of dice, there are two more dice, call them C and D. Die C has four sides with four spots and two sides with no spots; Die D has three spots with five spots and three sides with one spot. What is the probability that Die C will beat Die B? That Die D will beat Die C? That Die A will beat Die D? Justify your answers. What do you think of this?

    Presidents

    Imagine flipping a penny, a nickel and a dime together. Write down a list of all the possible outcomes of this experiment. Assign each outcome a probability.

    What is the probability that you will see three presidents?

    What is the probability that you will see exactly two presidents?

    What is the probability of seeing three presidents, given that at least one president is showing?

    What is the probability of seeing three presidents, given that Lincoln is showing?





    Ideas for Project Topics (these are just suggestions: Use your imagination)

    There are many, many possible topics that could be chosen. This is just a list of ideas. You may well have better topics, and there's no special reason to choose one of those in the list.

    Do cellphones cause cancer, and if they do, what should be done about it?
    Should every American be vaccinated against smallpox?
    Should every teenage girl be vaccinated against HPV? What about boys?
    What steps should be taken to increase security for airline passengers?
    What should be done about illegal drugs? Intensify the war on drugs, shift to education, legalize, medicalize, keep doing as we are?
    How should you prepare for your own financial future (e.g., retirement, college for my children)? Should you invest in stocks, bonds, CDs, the lottery? How to do this best?
    Is organic food better for you than nonorganic (or on the other hand is it more dangerous due to bacterial contamination as some have claimed)? Should I buy organic food?
    Does violence on TV cause crime? What should we do about it?
    What kinds of insurance should you carry? How does this depend on your personal situation?
    What are the risks in the criminal justice system? E.g., what is the probability that innocent people are convicted (and even get the death penalty), and on the other hand, what is the probability that guilty people escape punishment? How should society (and juries) take this into account in their verdicts?
    Should Vermont Yankee be relicensed? It is the same design as the Japanese reactors that are currently in trouble.
    Should we worry about global warming, and if so, what should we do about it? Can we do anything effective about it?
    Should we worry about the earth being hit by a "killer asteroid," and if so, what should we do about it? Can we do anything about it?
    Are there health risks over which we have some control? What are they and what actions should be taken to improve our personal health?
    Do SUVs roll over with greater frequency than other kinds of automobiles? What should be done about it?
    What should we do about Afghanistan?
    Is genetically engineered food dangerous, or on the other hand is it beneficial? Should society ban or encourage the sale of these foods?
    Overuse of antibiotics can lead to their becoming ineffective as bacteria evolve resistance. What are the risks here and what should be done about it?
    Is bilingual education a good policy, or would it be better to ban it as California has recently done?
    What would be the effect of introducing vouchers into the public education system? Would it improve education? Would there be unintended consequences?



    Safety Decision Problem

    Suppose that 5,000 lives per year would be saved by equipping every new car sold in the US with a particular safety device. Suppose that 15 million cars are sold every year, and that the device costs $200 to install in each car. Would it be economically worthwhile to require that all cars be equipped with the safety device? Where is the break-even point in the cost of the device between it's being economically worthwhile to install and not economically worthwhile to install? (If you decided that it was worthwhile to install at $200 per device, there will be a larger cost at which it is not worthwhile; if it was not worthwhile to install at $200 per device, there will be a lower cost at which it is worthwhile to install).

    NOTES:

    You can treat this problem in terms of the costs and lives saved or lost per year, since it may be assumed that as new cars are manufactured, old ones are junked in approximately the same numbers. This is not exactly true but is close enough for our purposes.

    In order to answer this question, you are going to have to assign a monetary value to a human life. This is not only difficult and uncertain, but also seems somehow unethical. Yet governments and companies have to make such assignments in order to allocate resources, which are always limited. One way to think about it might be in terms of the amount of life insurance that a prudent person with dependents might carry in order to protect against the chance that he or she might die. Another way to think about it might be in terms of the average amount of damages that a company might be liable for if it were faced with lawsuits for a product that could have had the device but did not, resulting in someone's death. A third way to think about it might be in terms of the lifetime earnings that an average person might expect to earn over a working lifetime of 40-45 years. Using one or all of these methods, assign a value to a human life. Use this value in your decision tree to decide whether or not it is worthwhile, from this purely monetary point of view, to require that the device be installed. Note that although in theory it might be possible to make a completely safe car, it would cost so much that no one could afford it, so inevitably society has to strike a balance between safety and cost. Such tradeoff decisions are therefore necessary.

    Also, unlike the lottery problem, where the goal was to maximize your expected return, here the goal is to minimize the expected cost (including the monetary value of lives that could have been saved but were not, if we decide not to require that the device be installed).
